# Forms Roadmap

## ✅ Completed
- ✅ Base set of custom fields (text, select, checkbox, etc.) for RHF.
- ✅ Zod validation support in auth forms.
- ✅ Auth checkbox unification using the custom field.
- ✅ Base style improvement in `JBCheckboxField` (border, hover, spacing, label).
- ✅ Base size for `JBTextField/JBSelectField/JBDatePickerField/JBTimePickerField` stabilized to default `size="medium"`.
- ✅ Visual size adjustments in auth buttons for better readability.

## 🟡 In Progress
- 🟡 Single guide for mixed `rules` + `zodResolver` usage.
- 🟡 Expansion of common fields based on real project usage.

## 🔜 Pending
- 🔜 Visual field catalog with scenario-based examples.
- 🔜 Consumer-configurable theming (density/sizes/states).
- 🔜 Test coverage for form components.

## 🚧 Risks / Technical Debt
- 🚧 Per-project style variations can break consistency without shared tokens.
