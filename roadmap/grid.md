# Grid Roadmap

## ✅ Completed
- ✅ Initial definition with paginated approach.
- ✅ Current decision: keep pagination as the primary mode.

## 🟡 In Progress
- 🟡 Integration review with TanStack Query for data orchestration.

## 🔜 Pending
- 🔜 State persistence (filters, columns, sort).
- 🔜 Full server-side operation (sorting/filtering/pagination).
- 🔜 Formal evaluation of infinite scroll vs pagination per use case.

## 🚧 Risks / Technical Debt
- 🚧 UX requirements may differ by domain and force two loading strategies.
